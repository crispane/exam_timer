# exam_timer
- A Timer script written in Python, ideal for multiple choice exams.
- It features a **Time Pool**, that shows how much _time you have saved_ for answering questions fast.
- It starts at 0 and time is added or subtracted everytime you press **Next Question**.
- **Time Pool's** countdown is enabled after **Question Time** is depleted.
- If it drops below zero, it gets negative values indicating lost time.
